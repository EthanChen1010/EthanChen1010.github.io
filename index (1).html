        <p class="lead mb-4">I grew up in Diamond Bar, California. I come from a family of 6; mom and dad, 2 sisters and 1 brother. My early life consisted of me going to tutoring,
         music lessons, and sports. I grew up playing drums but switched over to electric bass. I was active in basketball, baseball, and soccer in my youth, but as I grew up 
         I slowly started to take an interest into boxing. I boxed for about 1 and a half - 2 years before I had injured my back. I've recently taken an interest in bowling. I 
         hope one day that I can play in league for bowling maybe even go pro in bolwing. As of right now I bowl for fun with my friends and family and plan on getting my own
         bowling ball and shoes soon. Other than that I spend most of my time playing bass and making tablatures for songs that don't have any available online. <br><br>
        I am a devout Christian who serves in the church as the bass player for the youth and college ministry, aswell as for main services. Growing up I was raised in a Christian
        household but there was a period of time where I became atheist. After a few years of struggling with personal health I decided to try and go back to my religion. After some
        time I was able to overcome my struggles and improve on my mental and physical health greatly. I currently serve the church by playing bass on the praise team every friday
        night for the college ministry and at least one sunday of every month for main service. I also volunteer every so often for the kids ministry as one of the babysitters.
        I am currently an enrolled undergraduate student at the University of California, Riverside as a psychology major. I am on the pre-med route for psychology and hope to 
        become a psychiatrist some time down the road. Psychiatry stood out to me not because of the amazing pay, but because of the fact that I was able to help people. It
        was always my calling to actively help others around me if I could and help them become a better person.
